# Thanks for visiting!

## Techs:
TS
Postgres
GraphQL with ApolloServer
Express

## env variables:

DB_USER=
DB_HOST=
DB_DATABASE=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=

JWT_SECRET=

Note, I have hard coded SQL to match locally run DB and tables.

## If I had more time...

- I would have implemented caching and batching in my Apollo Server.
- I would implement roles on to users, which can be retrieved by context at the point of login. These roles would determine if a user has permission to change data
- Implement HTTP response status codes
